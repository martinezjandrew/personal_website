# About Me

I’m in my final semester at St. Edward’s University, completing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. This milestone caps a 5½-year educational journey, including an Associate of Applied Science in LAN Administration with a Cybersecurity specialization, earned in 2022.

My professional career began in high school with an IT internship at Austin Water, followed by an internship-to-contract role with the Housing Authority of the City of Austin. At St. Edward’s, I joined the IT department, where I advanced from A/V Specialist to my current role as an Integration Developer. These experiences have deepened my technical expertise while giving me hands-on exposure to real-world IT and development challenges. They also showed me how critical IT is in supporting public-serving institutions and the communities they impact.

Since graduating high school in 2020, I’ve grown tremendously as a technologist. Now, I’m excited to bring my passion for software development, system integration, and problem-solving into the professional world.

title: ScriboAI
description: |
  ScriboAI was the senior project I developed at St. Edward's University with Aiman Zoqi (/aimanzoqi).
  ScriboAI is a web-based platform that simplies and accelerates the creation of training programs, utilizing LLMs.
  The goal was to overcome common challenges in creating training programs for small or medium-sized organizations.

    ScriboAI was the senior project I developed at St. Edward's University with Aiman Zoqi (/aimanzoqi).
    ScriboAI is a web-based platform that simplies and accelerates the creation of training programs, utilizing LLMs.
    The goal was to overcome common challenges in creating training programs for small or medium-sized organizations.

- title: WeGo TAAS Solution
  description: |
    This project was worked on for my Software Engineering class.
    In a group of 8, we simulated agile software development to create an extensible framework for deploying transportation-as-a-service (TAAS) applications which would interact with a network of autonomous driving vehicles, hosted by WeGo.
    Our alpha demo included a two cloud solution, one to host the service hosting the TAAS applications and the other to simulate a network of autonomous vehicles.

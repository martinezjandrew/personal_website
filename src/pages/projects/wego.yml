title: WeGo TAAS Solution
description: |
  This project was worked on for my Software Engineering class.
  In a group of 8, we simulated agile software development to create an extensible framework for deploying transportation-as-a-service (TAAS) applications which would interact with a network of autonomous driving vehicles, hosted by WeGo.
  Our alpha demo included a two cloud solution, one to host the service hosting the TAAS applications and the other to simulate a network of autonomous vehicles.
stack:
  [django python framework, python, reactJS, mySql, gunicorn, nginx, mongoDB]
integrated apis: MapBox

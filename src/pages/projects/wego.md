# WeGo TAAS Solution

---

## Description

This project was worked on for my Software Engineering class. In a group of 8, we simulated agile software development to create an extensible framework for deploying transportation-as-a-service (TAAS) applications which would interact with a network of autonomous driving vehicles, hosted by WeGo. Our alpha demo included a two cloud solution, one to host the service hosting the TAAS applications and the other to simulate a network of autonomous vehicles.
